CodeAcross Sacramento is a civic hackathon that will bring together professionals from the area to work on solutions to some of the problems identified at CityCamp, and more. Weâ€™ll spend the day developing first versions of new civic startups and open source projects that Code for Sacramento volunteers will contribute to in 2015.

If you're a developer, designer, or engaged citizen, CodeAcross Sacramento is an opportunity to collaborate with other civic innovators and makers.

Got an idea for a project? Let us know in advance so we can help you organize.
