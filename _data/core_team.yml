  bio: Joel had a 15-year career in state and local government, including several years working for the California Legislature, before striking out on his own as an independent consultant in 2014. Simulaneously, he started showing up at Code for Sacramento meetings and liked what he saw. Joel is committed to better connecting citizens to government data and services, conducting cutting-edge data analysis, creating informative data visualizaitons, and raising his two sons, though not necessarily in that order.
